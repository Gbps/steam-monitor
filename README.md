# steam-monitor
Hooks into processes that use the Steamworks API. It can hook all virtual functions in a vftable of a Steam API interface to intercept calls and send them back over an IPC interface to a GUI to display the results. It also has a python script that can pull all virtual functions out of the SDK headers and create a JSON file to help display the results.

# What's the status of this project?
Very work in progress. I might continue on this, might not. Who knows. It's all for fun anyways.
